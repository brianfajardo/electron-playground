# Video Info ▶️
Trying out Electron. Created a small little app which tells you the duration of a video on your hard drive.

💡 Things learnt while making the app:
- Electron BrowserWindow combines the utility of both Node and Chromium
- Communication between BrowserWindow and Electron app (ran on Node) is through Inter-process Communication (IPC)
- Communication is event-based
- Electron provides API methods to bridge the communication via IPC
- In BrowserWindow,
  - Sending an event to app/Node uses `ipcRenderer.send(EVENT_NAME, DATA_TO_SEND)`
  - Receiving an event from app/Node uses `ipcRenderer.on(EVENT_NAME, DATA_TO_RECEIVE)`
- In contrast, Electron app (running in Node),
  - Send events via `ipcMain.send(EVENT_NAME, DATA_TO_SEND)`
  - Receiving events via `ipcMain.on(EVENT_NAME, DATA_TO_RECEIVE)`

### 🔧 Installation Guide:

`npm install`

`npm run electron`
