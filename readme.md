# Electron ‚ö°Ô∏è
I've been wanting to try out Electron as a means to create desktop applications with #JavaScript. This repo is my electron playground as I fiddle around with the Electron API.

I want to eventually try incorporating React/Redux into an Electron project and see how that goes. üôè

Here is a list of things which you may not have known was built with Electron:
  * Atom Code Editor
  * Visual Studio Code
  * GitHub Desktop
  * Discord - voice and text chat for gamers
  * Slack
  * WordPress.com
  * WebTorrent
